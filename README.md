# Privacy Policy – The Price of YOU!

Last updated: August 2025

The The Price of YOU! Chrome extension (“extension”, “we”, “our”) is designed to give you insight into how websites profit from your attention and data. This policy explains what information is collected, how it is stored, and your rights as a user.

⸻

## Information We Collect

The extension analyzes your browsing activity to generate local estimates of website revenue. Specifically, it may collect:
	•	Attention signals: active time spent on a site, ad request counts, tracker domains.
	•	Data signals: detection of trackers, fingerprinting scripts, and email capture forms.
	•	Domain-level stats: per-site totals (time, estimated revenue, tracker/ads counts).

This data is collected locally on your device only and is never transmitted to our servers or third parties.

⸻

## How Information Is Used
	•	To calculate and display estimated values of attention/data profit within the extension popup.
	•	To provide cumulative totals and “since reset” history until you choose to reset.
	•	To let you voluntarily tip/donate through the optional “Buy me a beer” button (Stripe-hosted checkout).

⸻

## What We Do NOT Do
	•	We do not collect or store personal identifiers (name, email, account info).
	•	We do not sell or share your browsing data.
	•	We do not transmit your browsing history or tracker data to any remote server.

All analysis and storage occurs within your browser using Chrome’s local storage.

⸻

## Third-Party Services
	•	Stripe: If you click the “Buy me a beer” donation button, you will be redirected to Stripe’s hosted checkout page. Stripe may collect payment information under their own Privacy Policy. We do not receive or store any of your payment details.

⸻

## Your Choices
	•	You may reset or clear all collected data at any time by pressing the “Reset” button in the extension popup.
	•	You may uninstall the extension to remove all data permanently.
